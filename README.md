# Assessment for Week 6

Being a developer requires an acute attention to detail. The expectation of this assessment is that all instructions are read carefully and followed completely.

A good developer will ask clarifying questions when a task is unclear and use all the resources at their disposal.

The step-by-step instructions [here](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/Syllabus/blob/main/github/assessments.md) breakdown the git and GitHub process for this assessment.

Assessment should be accessed through the GitHub Classroom link provided in your cohort Slack channel.

A complete assessment is a meaningful and valid attempt on every answer. Incomplete assessments will not be reviewed.

This assessment is due *before* class begins on Monday of **Week 8**.
